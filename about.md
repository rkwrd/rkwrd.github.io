In order to escape the physical and mental complacency that comes with a comfortable office job, I booked a flight somewhere. That's how it started.
The site's name serves two functions: Firstly, it's supposed to remind me to do more every day. Secondly, I love the thought of an actual sloth pulling itself over a fence at glacier-like speeds while a zookeeper yells in the background "NOOOOOOO, COOOOOMEEEE BAAAAAAACK!"
