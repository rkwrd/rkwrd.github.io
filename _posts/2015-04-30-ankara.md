The coach ride from Safranbol√º to Ankara took me about three, four hours. We drove southwest towards [[bolu??]] and then southeast towards our destination. The journey took us through some beautiful mountains and plains, parts of which stil held small patches of snow. So much for my plans to travel through warm countries only...

Another thing I noticed during the drive were many small villages along the highway. Most of them looked...poor. Small cabins and sheds nailed together from driftwood and tarp. People dressed in patched, stained clothes toiling away on acres the size of tennis courts with handheld tools. Even in the small cities we passed, most houses were in various states of disrepair and trash was strewn everywhere. Trash also seamed every single meter of road, even in the otherwise most untouched places.

But aboard the coach I had wifi and coffee, so that was good.

The view changed quickly as we approached Ankara: First, there were industrial buildings. Next came massive warehouses, then your assorted megastores and car dealerships. Before long, I saw the city. Ankara is somewhat larger than Izmir and it looks very different: Since the development of Ankara as the capital took place within the last [[XXXX years], the city is incredibly modern. More modern in fact than any city in, say, Germany. Wherever I looked, I saw shiny, new towers of glass and steel, and more were being built all over the city. The contrast between this and the countryside I'd just passed through could not have been more striking. 

The coach took us past several parks and military installations before reaching the coach station. Again, the coach company provided a handy - and free! - shuttle service to the city centre.

The shuttle itself was easy enough to find: I walked up to the tourist information and grabbed a map. The attendant pointed me towards a carpark full of shuttles. Waving the map energetically, I walked up to a group of teenagers outside and quickly learned which shuttle I needed to get on. This was done by pointing at spots on the map, grunting and waving my hands about. Works like a charm.

**Lesson 0089:** *English. By and large, they don't speak it here. They teach it as a mandatory class in school, which apparently does a sterling job of turning people off of ever learning the basics. Outside the tourist-y places, speaking English didn't get me very far. Pointing and grunting did. Generally, the young are more likely to understand English than the old. Those of the female persuasion often seem to speak better English than those of male, but are also more hesitant about starting to speak it. While this whole thing is a bit inconvenient at times, it's not really a hindrance. It's not a reason to get frustrated either: After all, I'm the one who goes to Turkey without speaking Turkish...But I sure am glad I downloaded the offline language pack for Google Translate.*

As I hadn't planned on coming to Ankara, I had neglected to look up a hostel. So I grabbed a quick meal and found myself a nice cafe with wifi. After finding a hostel and reading for a bit, I walked over the hostel, got a bed and stashed my belongings. Then I went out to explore the city.

##Underrated!
The late afternoon found me walking north through the city center and up into the neighbourhood of the university. Past a concert hall advertising its rendition of 'Carmen' and through a nice little park.

Is it me or does that park look like a cat on a bicycle?

The mosque in question. It's big.

It's also big on the inside, and rather pretty.

Why does everything have to be either an incline or stairs?
