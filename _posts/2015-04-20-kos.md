##Grumpy mornings
For the last leg of my journey through Greece I took a ferry from Santorini to the island of Kos. Kos is actually so close to the Turkish coast that most people tend to assume the island is part of Turkey. It is also what you might call a tourist shithole. But since it was pre-season still, I resolved to try my luck before escaping to Turkey.

So I ended up taking a ferry from Santorini close to one o'clock in the morning. Since I had chosen the cheapest ticket, I did not get a cabin like a civilized person would. Instead I boarded the ferry (yes, shiny blue ferry!) with a handful of bleary-eyed tourists and began looking for a cushioned, flat surface. The ferry had come all the way from Athens and stopped at several islands. Consequently, all the good spots were already taken. I resigned myself to a short stretch of couch I extended with a heavy high-backed chair. Voila!

Fleece rolled up as a pillow, rainjacket as a blanket and earplugs to give me peace and quiet.

**Lesson 005:** *Earplugs! Unlike most of the other lessons, this is one I actually learned a while back. You can't travel without earplugs. Maybe you think you can, because you're an exceptionally heavy sleeper. But some day you'll sleep in a dorm with a Romanian truck driver. Or on a boat with a broken muffler. Or there is a noisy civil war going on. In any of those cases, earplugs will keep you from rising grumpy.* 

I rose _extremely_ grumpy. In part, because the entire night Greek action movies were blaring from a nearby TV and the occasial explosion must have reached my ear. Mostly though, because I know we would arrive around 04:30h. Somehow knowing that I get to sleep very little makes it hard for me to get any sleep whatsoever.

All in all I was not at my best as a grabbed my possessions and trudged down the stairs to the ferry's gangway. I remember standing inside the neon-lit belly of the ferry and viciously chewing on a piece of gym. Amidst the cars stood other passengers, few of them looked well-rested. Most of them must have felt just as exhausted as I did, but I was tired and therefor pissed off, so I glared at them angrily anyway.

Soon a klaxon was sounded and the loading gate was lowered with an awful lot of noise. Looking out, Kos didn't seem like anything special. Then again, I only saw the outlines of some buildings and a few yellow-ish streetlights. For a moment I was wondering: Why do I do this again?

Normally, my arrival protocol entails sitting down for a cup of coffee and taking a moment to let my brain catch up. At 04:30h in the morning this wasn't really an option and the port seemed pretty dead. Since I didn't think I'd be able to check into any rooms, I decided to go for a walk around the port instead.

Grumpiness nonwithstanding, I began to wonder if I was onto something as I noticed the massive ancient stonewalls surrounding part of the port. Intrigued I took some detours and found myself striding through a silent park and through gates in the walls. The air was cool and rich with the smell of blooming trees and bushes. Just as I reached the other side of the port, the horizon lit up. I found myself staring at the sun rising over the Turkish coast in the distance. For half an hour I just stood there, watching as the sunlight washed over the harbor, the marina and the small cafes and restaurants on the promenade. Right, that's why I'm doing this!

Suddenly a lot less grumpy, I wandered off towards the city centre, along the beach.

This, right here!

Considerably placated I found a place renting out apartments and sat down on the stairs overlooking the quiet street.

Eventually, a stately-looking lady opened the door and invited me in. Through a mixture of my rogueish charme, my exhausted appearance and the fact that it was still pre-season, I managed to haggle the price down by half. And thus I had a perfectly neat room with a double for 2 nights. After dumping my stuff I went for a walk and got breakfast. Then I took a long, luxurious nap.


##Lazy days
I basically continued that nap, with minor interruptions, for two more days. Whenever I accidentally woke from my slumber - pesky biorythm! - I would go for a walk
