##Grumpy mornings
For the last leg of my journey through Greece I took a ferry from Santorini to the island of Kos. Kos is actually so close to the Turkish coast that most people tend to assume the island is part of Turkey. It is also what you might call a tourist shithole. But since it was pre-season still, I resolved to try my luck before escaping to Turkey.

So I ended up taking a ferry from Santorini close to one o'clock in the morning. Since I had chosen the cheapest ticket, I did not get a cabin like a civilized person would. Instead I boarded the ferry (yes, shiny blue ferry!) with a handful of bleary-eyed tourists and began looking for a cushioned, flat surface. The ferry had come all the way from Athens and stopped at several islands. Consequently, all the good spots were already taken. I resigned myself to a short stretch of couch I extended with a heavy high-backed chair. Voila!

Fleece rolled up as a pillow, rainjacket as a blanket and earplugs to give me peace and quiet.

**Lesson 005:** *Earplugs! Unlike most of the other lessons, this is one I actually learned a while back. You can't travel without earplugs. Maybe you think you can, because you're an exceptionally heavy sleeper. But some day you'll sleep in a dorm with a Romanian truck driver. Or on a boat with a broken muffler. Or there is a noisy civil war going on. In any of those cases, earplugs will keep you from rising grumpy.* 

I rose _extremely_ grumpy. In part, because the entire night Greek action movies were blaring from a nearby TV and the occasial explosion must have reached my ear. Mostly though, because I know we would arrive around 04:30h. Somehow knowing that I get to sleep very little makes it hard for me to get any sleep whatsoever.

All in all I was not at my best as a grabbed my possessions and trudged down the stairs to the ferry's gangway. I remember standing inside the neon-lit belly of the ferry and viciously chewing on a piece of gym. Amidst the cars stood other passengers, few of them looked well-rested. Most of them must have felt just as exhausted as I did, but I was tired and therefor pissed off, so I glared at them angrily anyway.

Soon a klaxon was sounded and the loading gate was lowered with an awful lot of noise. Looking out, Kos didn't seem like anything special. Then again, I only saw the outlines of some buildings and a few yellow-ish streetlights. For a moment I was wondering: Why do I do this again?

Normally, my arrival protocol entails sitting down for a cup of coffee and taking a moment to let my brain catch up. At 04:30h in the morning this wasn't really an option and the port seemed pretty dead. Since I didn't think I'd be able to check into any rooms, I decided to go for a walk around the port instead.

Grumpiness nonwithstanding, I began to wonder if I was onto something as I noticed the massive ancient stonewalls surrounding part of the port. Intrigued I took some detours and found myself striding through a silent park and through gates in the walls. The air was cool and rich with the smell of blooming trees and bushes. Just as I reached the other side of the port, the horizon lit up. I found myself staring at the sun rising over the Turkish coast in the distance. For half an hour I just stood there, watching as the sunlight washed over the harbor, the marina and the small cafes and restaurants on the promenade.

Right, THIS is why I'm doing this!

Suddenly a lot less grumpy, I wandered off towards the city centre, along the beach.

This, right here!

Considerably placated I found a place renting out apartments and sat down on the stairs overlooking the still street.

Eventually, a stately-looking lady opened the door and invited me in. Through a mixture of my roguish charme, my pityfully exhausted appearance and the fact that it was still pre-season, I managed to haggle the price down by half. And thus I got two nights in a double for 20 euros. After dumping my stuff I went for a walk and got breakfast. Then I took a long, luxurious nap.


##Lazy days
I basically continued that nap, with minor interruptions, for two more days. Whenever I accidentally woke from my slumber - pesky biorythm! - I would go for a walk. The town looked about as empty as my brain felt, so I mostly stuck to the equally deserted beach. I passed the time wandering along the waterline and skipping flat stones over the waves. This mindless process of "See stone" -> "Grab stone" -> "Throw stone" -> "Repeat" proved almost meditative. Time begins to slow and eventually breaks down around you when you're looking for that perfect stone and that perfect pitch.

At some point I foolishly attempted to streamline the logistics by gathering a big pile of suitable stones and then chucking them all in quick succession. Of course that's hugely efficient. It also totally defeats the purpose of the exercise and almost left me with a dislocated shoulder. After that experience I ended up throwing with my weaker, left arm, which must have looked every bit as hilarious as it sounds.

**Lesson 006:** *The secret to a good skipping stone lies in both the stone and the throwing movement. You want a stone which is smooth and flat-ish. A certain amount of rounded bevel is necessary for it to skip upon contact with the waves, so shards of ceramic or flint don't work. I find that a slightly oblong shape provides better leverage for my fingers, resulting in better spin and thus more jumps. For the throw, I prefer a looping sideways pitch with a neutral grip. Haha, you suckers just spent 3 minutes reading about a guy chucking rocks in the sea!* 

I also recall taking a long walk through Kos' impressive marina. The entire thing was a charming mixture of clear blue water and...well, lots of boats. I don't really know anything about boats, but most of them where white, relatively shiny and somewhere between "somewhat large" and "definitely very large indeed".

Do you think this thing would be fast?

Looking decidedly out of place I resolved to walk around very purposefully. I also spent some serious time devising witty answers in case anybody asked me which one of the boats was mine. "Oh, just browsing, really. You got anything you'd recommend for whaling?"
Unfortunately, I must have walked so purposefully that people were just too intimidated to stop and ask me. 

I'm not ashamed to admit that the days in Kos were anything but productive (though I did manage to watch a series of videos on relational algebra). I'm lazy, so sue me!

After two days I began to feel that particular itch in my bones, telling me to move on. So I took a ferry from Kos over to Bodrum, Turkey. 


##Resume of my time in Greece
Since this is was the last bit on Greece, I should probably try to wrap up my experience there.

###It's pre-season for a reason
First off, I was there at the wrong time. Well, technically every Greek person assured me that normally the weather isn't this bad this time of year. The effect was the same though: I remember being cold more often than being warm. I also used my rainjacket way more than my sunscreen.

At the same time, being there before all the tourists arrive was a blessing. Especially on the islands many locals told us various horror-stories about the numbers of tourists that would descend on the small towns like drunk, sunburned and tattooed locusts. If that's not your thing - it sure isn't mine - than you really want to go to the islands outside of main season. Given my experiences with the weather, I would probably prefer to go post-season rather than pre-season. That way, the weather might be a bit more predictable.


###Nobody told me they hated me
Well, at least not to my face. Coming from Germany, I had mild reservations about going to Greece. "Sorry your economy is in the toilet, but isn't it lovely how cheap everything is?"

But somehow this never came up. I didn't even see any riots in Athens, which was a bit of a letdown, really. No burning flags or Merkel effigies either.

I had several conversations with locals about the whole topic (mostly young people). The consensus there seemed to be that the whole Euro-kerfuffle was a thing of politics, and politics were always fucked up. You know, the elites oppressing the little man like you and I. But you and I, we got along just fine, right?

On the one hand that was reassuring to hear. On the other hand, I could not help but wonder if the fact that I sat right across from them may have moderated their positions a bit. Maybe they didn't really feel like expressing their whole opinions to my face? After all, I couldn't really blame them for being angry about the economic situation. One way or another, people were consistently friendly, so I have no complaints there.

###Everybody here should be fat
Right at the start of my trip, in Thessaloniki, I asked the hostel staff to recommend a restaurant. "You like meat?" they asked back. Those words warmed my heart. Why yes, I do! And meat likes me! Meat and I are made for each other!

From a meat perspective, Greece was all I could have asked it to be. Grilled, fried, cooked, you name it. Meat of course does not make anyone fat. But virtually anything else served here does. The sheer variety of pies , puff pastries and sugary desserts would be enough to give a heart attack a bad case of dia-beetus (sic).

One explanation why you don't see more round-ish people must be that most of Greece is built on hills. So whereever you go, you're either working your way up an incline or doing your best not to fall down one. 

The other one might lie in serving control. This, most foreigners clearly sucked at: On one occasion, two Americans and I devoured a huge serving of juicy, sugary baclava right in the bakery. The digusted look the owner gave us had "You animals!" written all over it. I think we may have devoured what was meant as a family serving each.

###Damn, it's a beautiful country
Even ignoring all other benefits Greece has to offer, the nature alone would compel me to go again. I didn't see a single part (excluding Patisia, Athens) that wasn't beautiful in some way. You know what I'm talking about, you saw the pictures! Hills, mountains, rivers, cliffs, fields, and of course the sea. Oh, the sea! If nothing else, go there for the sea!
