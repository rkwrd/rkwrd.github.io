#What about 'dem Greeks?

Most of my friends come from tech-y/science-y backgrounds, like maths, physics, engineering or computer science. As a social scientist I'm the odd one out because I don't really have a favorite equation and rarely have to resort to using pre-greek alphabets in calculations. But ever since those Greeks started messing with our beloved common currency, I've had people quietly ask me how that whole story would continue. **Will Greece remain in the Eurozone?**

Until now, my answer has been a resounding "Huh? Whatthehelldoiknow?", but after two degrees in that particular field this does seem a bit unsatisfactory. So I figured I might just use the time I have now to actually dig into that question a bit for my own entertainment. If that turns out educational, I will consider that a bonus.

Since the whole situation isn't entirely straight forward, I will use this first article to provide some basic background on the political and economical dimensions of this question, before delving into future scenarios later on.

As a matter of principle I'm only friends with people who are either smarter than me, or funny-looking. So please, feel free to send me corrections, comments or selfies!

###Current situation
As of 2015, Greece's economy is down on its knees as a result of various aftereffects of the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. These troubles have heavily damaged Greece's national economy, its standing in financial markets, the reputation of its government and the standard of living of its citizens. The outcome of different aspects of the crisis is evident in some very basic indicators:

* GDP: 356bn USD (2008) -> 242bn USD (2013) (Worldbank)
* Unemployment: 7% (2008) -> 27% (2014) according to EL.STAT
* Public debt: 113% GDP (2008) -> 175% (2013) (Eurostat)
* Credit rating:
* Refinancing rate:

Ouch. These figures alone show clearly, that Greece is generating significantly less economic output than before, which also accrues to fewer people. This generates less tax revenue for the government, which is sinking deeper and deeper into debt. It's lowered credit rating means that potential lenders demand a higher risk premium. Consequently, the capital needed to pay off debt is borrowed at an increasingly high cost. 

###Importance of the Eurozone

For better or worse, no country is an island (not even the UK, geography nonwithstanding) and Greece is entangled in a number of international arrangements. First and foremost it's a EU member state, and part of the Eurozone. It's membership in the [[currency union]] has shown itself to be both blessing and curse:

Initially, the European Economic Community (EEC) was conceived in 1957 as a European free-trade area to boost economic development through a larger, common market. This was intended to make Europe more competitive vis-a-vis the US and competitors in Asia. There was also hope of preventing future European wars through economic interdependence. Greece has been a member of the EEC since 1981 and benefited significantly.

After the implementation of the common market, the introduction of the Euro as a common currency was the next step of European integration: Its objective was to eliminate exchange rate risks within the currency union and provide a more stable, more inert currency. The challenges of tying the very diverse European economies into a single currency are beyond the scope of this article. In short, so-called Convergence Criteria were agreed upon, which sought to ensure responsible financial policies of the Eurozone members. [[Greece joined the Eurozone in 2001, ostensibly fulfilling the convergence criteria. In hindsight, we know that they pulled off a massive scam to get into the Euro: They managed to hide the extent of their debt with the aid of some of the big professional serves firms: http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/greek-debt-crisis-how-goldman-sachs-helped-greece-to-mask-its-true-debt-a-676634.html]]

Why was Greece so intent on joining the Euro if it clearly wasn't fit to do so? 

[
- all other partners were deemed more creditworthy -> cheaper borrowing
- how did greece borrow money with the drachma?
- how did it work with the EUR?

Once the crisis hit, Greece's membership in the Eurozone became a decidedly double-edged sword:

As more and more financial institutions became insolvent in a massive chain reaction, international lending threatened to stop entirely. The credit freeze was only prevented by large-scale government bailouts of financial institutions (which governments providing various guarantees and buying toxic assets).

Starting in [[XXXX]], most southern European countries were in severe financial distress. In the financial markets this knowledge spread quickly. This exerted downward-pressure on the value of the Euro

On the one hand, the other members of the Eurozone - especially the big ones such as Germany and France - directed massive capital flows to Greece to be used for aid. While we're all free to believe in some altruistic motif for these aid payments, it would be more realistic to see them as an expression of enlightened self-interest: Since all Euro-members sit in the same boat, they share an interest in keeping the exchange rate of the Euro within a stable range: Lower exchange rates benefit exports at the expense of trade partners. Higher exchange rates dampen exports and throttle domestic economies. Yet, populist leaders in northern Europe decry that supposed waste of money. It is downright baffling how people who will readily 





[why and how]


On the other hand, being tied to the common currency barred Greece from many of the policy choices usually employed by countries when their balance sheets start looking like Satan's own septic tank:

The common choice for an economy in distress is to start printing money: The central bank will start pumping liquidity into the market via open-market operations. The higher availability of money at a lower interest rate is then expected to stimulate economic activity as businesses and consumers take advantage of the access to cheap capital. This expansive monetary policy would usually be coupled with expansive fiscal policy, in which the government creates additional demand though public procurement and spending. The accepted downside of this policy-mix is inflation, which may scare away international investors, as it eats into the returns of their investments. Consequently, currency exchange rates will eventually adjust to the new inflation level, effectively causing a devaluation.

Critically, this policy choice is not available to Greece: As a member of the Eurozone, the Greek government does not have control over the relevant central bank (the ECB). The ECB is heavily influenced by the orthodoxy of the German Bundesbank and maintains low to very low levels of inflation within the Eurozone. For

###What's next
[[]]
In summary: Greece snuck into the Euro to benefit from the higher credit-worthiness of the currency union. that has become a burden in the time of crisis, both to greece and the euro countries.

In the mainstream media we get the usual dog-and-pony show: You see the Greek Voldemort of Game Theory, Austerity-Angela and all the rest. Who doesn't love a good drama with relatable characters? Unfortunately, people tend to look at that sort of theatre and assume that's what politics is all about and then write it off as boring. If that was all there is to it, I would agree. Luckily, that's just the surface: Instead, we will look the murky depths below - at power, fear and greed.



Mwahahaha!
