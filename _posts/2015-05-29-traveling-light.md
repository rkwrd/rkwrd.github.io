*"Is that it?" - She*

The advantages of traveling light have been analyzed in excrutiating detail on a great number of travel sites and forums. Let me save you the time and present the key principle of traveling light: **Things are heavy. You don't want to carry them.**


Most backpackers look like they are moving house for a year. I blame two faulty lines of thought:

(1) If you travel for longer, you need more everything.

(2) Foreign countries do not have shops, ever.

So these hobo-hoarders go out and get themselves a nice 90-litre hiking pack. What goes well with that? Oh yeah, a second, smaller pack they can carry on their chest! That's useful because it allows them to strap their sleeping bags on there, too.

On the one hand, it must be nice to have everything you could possibly need with you. On the other hand, I don't want to go *beep!*-*beep!*-*beep!* while awkwardly reversing off a train because all that gear is too bulky for me to turn around. I have carried heavy equipment for extended periods, and I'm not a fan. The prospect of doing that for an entire year is incredibly off-putting to me.

So I decided not to. After all, I was going to stay in civilization (or whatever passes for it) for most of the time. I knew I would be able to buy additional things as needed. This also meant that I would leave your more typical hiking-gear, like a hiking boots, tent and sleeping bag. Instead, I would just bring the basics. When I inspected my gear before leaving Samsun, I took this picture:

So, let's see:

* this
* that
* other things.

And here is all that stuff packed up nicy and tidy:

If I'm completely honest, even this bag could stand to lose a few items. I might still eliminate one or two t-shirts and the pair of jeans.
