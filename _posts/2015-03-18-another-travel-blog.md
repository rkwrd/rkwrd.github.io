Just as I had settled in on Thessaloniki's lustrous promenade, my peace was disturbed by a scary thought. Staring into the sunset over the bay and puffing on my lone celebratory cigar I was startled by the question "What if my friends forget about me?" 

Before my departure some of my friends had indeed asked for regular status updates on my trip and/or whether my head was still attached to my shoulders (Day 1: yes).

Cleary keeping my friends informed individually seems like a lot of repetition, which makes it very likely that I would eventually start neglecting that part, possibly losing touch. However, this could easily be solved by putting some regular updates online at a central location.

However I don't really like or trust Facebook anymore, so putting all my stuff on there didn't exactly appeal to me either.

The obvious consequence then is a blog, something I had discussed with some of my friends as well.
Here is the problem though: Since I am now traveling, my blog would be a travel blog. I don't like travel blogs.
Whilst preparing for my trip I had skimmed through many travel blogs and quite simply I thought too many of them were shit. 
Most of them seem to consist of listicles (a topic worthy of a rant of its own. Spoiler: I don't like them.), "me at the beach" type pictures and rather heavy-handed prose.
Overall, I'm pretty sure that's not the kind of blog I would want to spend time on. Partially because of my drastic aversion to listicles, partially since I'm way too pale to be photographed at the beach. Lastly, I'm not under the delusion that I'm any kind of Hemingway.
So what is this blog going to be then? 
Hopefully not a travel blog!

As much as I enjoy traveling, this undertaking was never meant to be about the travel itself. Instead, I wanted to have the freedom and energy to immerse myself in topics I find interesting. Instead of going the formal-education route and earning another degree, I decided to pursue those interests on my own but at locations which are all a) sunnier, b) cheaper and c) friendlier than my birthplace. And if that's the idea, why limit myself to one location? There, that's how it accidentally turned into a trip.
So ideally, this blog will be mainly be growing on articles on the topics I'm researching (and of course various vitriolic rants).
I'm excited to see if I can put together content at a respectable frequency. in that regard this blog also serves as an experiment on my (lack of) self discipline.

But despair not, ye of little faith, I will surely write the occasional bit on my whereabouts (and yes, the status of my neck) and post pictures of beaches, wine-glasses and my horribly sun-burned mug. Hell, I might even take a shot at some destination-related articles with a bit of substance.

For the technically inclined amongst my esteemed readers: This blog is static html rendered using Jekyll. It's currently hosted on github pages, though I might move it to my own server at some point. 

The pleasantly simple theme I'm using is called "scribble".
