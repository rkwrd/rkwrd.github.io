##Expats being expats
Like the other Emirates, Bahrain depends on foreign workers, both in low-income service jobs and highly qualified specialist positions. As a result, the country's population is made up of around 46% Bahrainis, 45% Asians and assorted other groups.

While this seems extreme, consider the UAE as a whole: A whopping 19% of the population is Emirati (according to the CIA World Factbook, and the CIA never makes mistakes).

There is also a delightfully underhanded racism embedded in the semantics around immigration: Lowly-paid people of darker skin are referred to as immigrants. Well-paid, pasty ones are called expats.
