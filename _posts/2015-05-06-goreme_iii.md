Brace for a storm of landscape shots!

##The valley

The next day, Marc and I met Michael (from Poland) over breakfast. The three of us decided to go for a casual morning hike in one of the valleys (Kiliclar vadisi). The weather was gorgeous and the three of us picked a route which followed almost none of the suggested paths.

We started out by walking past (and through) some of the deserted rock houses. Having inspected them in detail, we then walked up to one of the large ridges lining the valley:

From the ridge, we climbed down into one of the smaller valleys, and for once followed a path for a while. Next, we tried to scale one of the opposite ridges, which took us over an hour. The white rock you see in the pictures is tufa, which is soft and porous at the best of times. Often enough, the rock itself was covered by layers of sand and dust, which looked just like the rockface itself. As we found out, it was utterly unsuited for even light climbing. So many times we though we had finally found a decent route out of the valley, we had to track back after feeling our hands slip in the layers of white dust. On the plus-side, we ran into this magnificent little dinosaur!

After several failed attempts, we finally found a way up on the rock, where this nice picture was taken:

We crossed over on the other side of the ridge and were suddenly looking down into the main valley. The fairy chimneys visible in the second picture are the same ones, Marc, Mohamed and I saw during our first day.

On the way down into the valley the three of us almost died, falling into a 6-8m deep chasm. No big deal though. Also, it turned out that there was a perfectly safe crossing just a few meters to the side. We just hadn't seen it.

As you can see, the fairy chimneys have a very characteristic shape. I will leave it to you to figure out what exactly the two gentlemen were doing here:

##The castle

Having seen the valley, we headed back to town in time for lunch. Marc and I were both scheduled to leave GÃ¶reme in the evening, but that would leave us the afternoon to do some more exploring. We decided on taking a minibus up to the castle which loomed over Pidgeon Valley.
