##Leaving Athens

On Sunday 05/04/2015, Holger and I left Athens to do some relaxed island-hopping in the Cyclades. Named after its shape (apparently), this group of islands is what people imagine when they hear "Greece". Beforehand, we had decided to make the best use of Holger's limited vacation time by visiting two islands: Milos (not very touristy) and Santorini (very, very touristy). We figured that way we might get a somewhat representative sample.

So on said Sunday we agreed to meet up at Athen's ferry terminal (yes, yes: it's technically in Pireas, but you really can't tell it's a different city). Since I dislike being late or missing flights, boats or coaches, I arrived at the port way too early. So after finding the correct gate, I had plenty of time to sprawl out in the shade and watch a number of ferries enter the port, dock, offload, load and depart. Sure, airports have that atmosphere of travel and adventure, but they often feel so rushed. Ships, now that's a different matter!

Anyway, before I get too philosophical: Ships. We took one of those. For around 50 euros per person you are allowed to get on one of the shiny ones. Hence we got on a shiny, blue catamaran one which would carry us to the island of Milos in around 4 hours.

The ferry was quite neat and well-equipped but we spent most of the trip on deck, looking at the fantastically blue water or the islands we passed.

##Milos

We reached Milos in the late afternoon and found our hotel pretty much immediately. Truth of the matter is that the town of Adamantas is rather small. We saw several hotels, hostels and rooms for rent, but it was clear that tourist season was yet to start. That might also be the reason why we managed to get a room with two beds for 10 euro per person and night. As we reached the place indicated on the booking confirmation, this guy walked up to us, ushered us into this room on the ground floor and I gave him 20 euros. Simple. The room seemed perfectly suitable, so we just dropped off our luggage and headed into town.

After a hearty meal in an almost completely empty restaurant and a few shots of raki, we wandered around the deserted town until after dark. Amongst other things, we came upon the island's mining museum. Turns out that Milos actually earns more revenue from mining rare earths and obsidian than from tourism. That at least explains the relatively low-key tourism infrastructure in the town. I was left wondering who in their right minds would mine for obsidian though. I knew that they were historically used as blades and arrow points, because these stones tend to have sharp, glass-like edges. Amusingly enough, that seems to be one modern application, too: Obsidian is used for experimental [scalpel blades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian#Current_use).

The next day we got up early (Hahaha...no. No, we didn't) and decided to do a quick hike along the northern-most cliffs before leaving the island with a ferry in the afternoon.

Up on the cliff. Near the edge. Thanks for the shock, Holger!


Just as we sat down on the beach behind the cliff, it started drizzling. Glancing up the ominuous-looking clouds above us we decided to leg it and scuttle back to the hotel before we got properly drenched. This turned out to be one of the better decisions we made, because just as we got close to the hostel, it started raining in earnest.
