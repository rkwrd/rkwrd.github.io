### The way out
After spending a good month in Turkey, I ventured onwards. The next obvious destination was Georgia, famous the first emergence of wine culture (around 6000 BCE) and a good, old Russian military intervention in 2008.

True to my own idiotic habit, I left Samsun via coach around midnight. Deviating from said habit, I actually managed to sleep a few hours before I awoke around 05:00 in the vincinity of Trabzon, on the Black Sea coast. Now, Trabzon itself looked fairly unspectacular and gave off the whole tourist-spot-awaiting-tourists vibe. But shortly afterwards, I found myself staring at these mountains and cliffs along the coast, all covered in lush greenery. Small towns and villages had been built into the steep mountainsides. All of this was revealed as the morning sun cut through the subtropical morning haze.

I have to admit that I felt a pang of regret at not stopping to investigate what looked like a really interesting region. During my trip I had actually been advised to plan a few days in this part of the world. Repeatedly. I'm not a very smart man.

After around two more hours of window-staring and biting the inside of my cheek, we stopped at the Georgian border, where I had to get off the coach. I weaseled my way through there ("Huh, do I need a visa here or not? Probably not, right? No, definitely not!").

To my great delight, I passed through the checkpoint without any problems. Unlike those who enter the country via the airport, I was not given the customary bottle of red wine. A friendly lady from the tourist information gave me a detailed rundown of what sights were awaiting me in Batumi. Then, I found myself sitting down with a cup of coffee, waiting for the bus. I used the time to take inventory of my time in Turkey.

### My thoughts on Turkey
Having been in Turkey twice, I've noticed a few recurring themes. Those presented here I have discussed with other travelers/tourists, who generally agreed with me (I think). Here goes:

### Overall friendly-ness
By and large, the Turks have been very friendly and helpful. I can't really recall anybody being unfriendly or rude. When you approach people, they will try to help you. At the same time, the country gets a fair share of tourists and many people make a living off of that. Consequently, many of them will act out of enlightened self-interest, especially with foreigners. Case in point, all cab drivers will agree that the best way to get from A to B is a cab, always. Most of the time, specifically their cab. After which you can stay at the hostel operated by their son-in-law.

This understandable business-mindset aside, most people in Turkey seem less grumpy than is the case in northern Europe. A lot of social life takes place in the street, where friends and family gather to have tea or just sit around and chat. Thus, most public places have a fairly personal atmosphere.

### Isolationism
The Turks are a fiercely proud nation, if the density of flags is any indication. While I have no objection to national awareness in general, in the case of Turkey it comes with a regrettable sense of isolationism: While they learn English in school, most of them don't actually speak more than a few words. Worse yet, I feel like I noticed a reluctance to even try speaking it, which affects the young as much as the old. From what I've heard from expats and locals alike, the Turks don't travel much abroad, either. I certainly don't remember running into any of them anywhere.

### Waiters and service
Overall, the service I have gotten at restaurants, hostels and transportation has been very good. However, there is one small thing that annoyed the hell out of me: I would sit at a coffee shop and do something on my notebook, and every damn 10 minutes a waiter would come by and try to snatch my half-full coffee cup away from me. Since I'd usually and up spending between 10-15 Euro on coffee and the cafes were mostly empty, I don't really know what the hell that was. Unfortunately I noticed this kind of over-eager pushiness in several places. I'm proud to report I did not stab anyone over this, but I certainly would have liked to. You touch my damn coffee at your own risk!

### Beggars and refugees
Compared to Greece, Turkey definitely seems to have more beggars lining the streets. While most of their strategies were not overly in-your-face, I had several experiences where I would sit outside and eat, only to have little kids (4-10y) walk up to me and start begging for food or money. Not a pleasant situation at all, and there isn't a whole lot you can do about it. Personally, I have long since decided not to give beggars money and I have stuck with that. I'm not an expert on poverty, but it seems to me that throwing them a few coins doesn't adress the problem. Since most people seem to know that, they must give money in order to assuage their conscience. Each to their own, but to me that seems delusional.

Another aspect I noticed was the number of Syrian refugees which I saw all over Turkey. Turkey has taken in a staggerin amount of refugees and while most of them are staying in refugee camps near the border, smaller groups and families have reached all regions. These groups would be found begging in the streets, looking even more sorry than any of the Turkish beggars. Especially when kids were involved, that was a tough sight to stomach.

### Easy travels
These notes may sound overly critical. On the whole, Turkey has been an amazingly easy country to travel in: It's fairly safe, has decent infrastructure and it's affordable. I got to practive my grunt-and-point method of communication and started what one day might be a tan. It's not all that different from the west, but different enough to be interesting.
