This morning I arrived in Manali, a small city in the lower Himalayas. I came here after a 14-hour bus ride from Delhi, which seems like a long trip for a distance of 550km. Then again, most of it was mountain road and part of me appreciates careful driving around sheer drops. Not that  our driver seemed overly concerned with careful driving. As the locals say with that delightful head-bob: "This is India."

Now I'm back in my room (300 rupees/night, around 4 EUR) and completely soaked. After having dinner in town I walked back uphill, through some heavy rain. Old Manali, where I stay, is lined with small hotels, homestays, bars and caf√©s. In the dark, their signs light up the raindrops and bathe the entire street in hazy light. The rain also washes streams of mud down the main road. I saw few people, since most had sought refuge from the downpour indoors. The countless stray dogs and free-roaming cows had gathered under trees and various overhangs.


 Manali is a strange place: Set in the most scenic mountain landscape you could imagine, it's also a highly touristic place. In summer, most people seem to come here to smoke weed or talk about smoking weed.
