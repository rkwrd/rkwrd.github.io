Two things in particular got me psyched about finally going to India, and both of them happened before I even started my trip:

First, the helpful doctor and the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Berlin commended me on my choice of destination: "India? Nice, very nice!" He then added "...so let's add those rabies shots to the list then!" - "It's just a prophylactic though, isn't it? What's the effect, really?" - "Well, the effect is mainly that if you get exposed, you're a little bit less likely to die." - "Oh...okay, add them to the list!"

Second, I visited a pharmacy to get some additions to my first-aid-kit (safety first!). The pharmacist peered over the counter: "Asia, eh? Including India?" - "Yeah." - "Okay, you'll need these!", he said, and slapped a family-sized pack of anti-diarrhea medication on the counter. Not "you might want these" or "these might come in handy", just stone-cold certainty.
