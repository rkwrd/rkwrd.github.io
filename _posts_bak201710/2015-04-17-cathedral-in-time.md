It's shortly past 11am here, and I'm sitting in a coffee shop on Izmir's highstreet, just parallel to the promenade. I'm having my coffee on the second floor, overlooking the steady stream of passers-by. They are playing quiet jazz in here, and serving excellent, strong coffee. When I look up from my screen I can see faint steam curling up from a coffee cup with a logo of an orange goat on it. The room around me is furnished in understated colors and is, apart from myself, completely empty.

I'm having a fairly productive day so far: I have drafted the second article on the Cyclades and checked out some connections from Izmir to Istanbul. I also spent a good amount of time on just observing the people passing underneath the window and day-dreaming. There is no rush, after all.

In fact, that is exactly what this trip is about: Taking the time. Getting out of a mindset in which every minute has to be filled and justified. To me, this was the most toxic aspect of full-time employment: Not so much having less free time, but feeling like I had to use what little free time I had left productively.

When asked "What did you do this weekend?" the answer "...nothing." is unacceptable, not only to others but to ourselves, too. Look at you, you had an entire weekend to live, and you did nothing?

These notions of productive use of spare-time and high-powered relaxation are a new phenomenon in the west: What did the lord do on the seventh day? Yoga and a workshop  on business etiquette! The jewish faith has its tradition of the Sabbath, which [[[[Heschel]]]] calls "a cathedral in time", a phrase I find amazing. Even hundreds of years back people saw the need to take a proper break every few days. Sure, many of them worked more physical jobs, but they worked less, worked slower and less stressfully. And here we are, feeling bad about sleeping in on a Sunday morning.

With or without religious aspirations, it seems that taking the time to do nothing is becoming increasingly rare. If you're just sitting there, you might as well put on an audiobook, right? Oh, look: a Facebook message!

Productivity, both in work and in spare time, is all the rage of course. We admire the movers and shakers. Those who do! In work, this easily leads to counterproductive activism and burn-outs. In spare time, the results are even more absurd: "Buy experiences, not products" has become the mantra of the seemingly more enlightened consumer. Unfortunately, the attitude about experiences is much the same as about products: Collect them. Show them. Get more. This also explains why some people travel with checklists: "3000 years old you say? Amazing! - **CLICK** - Okay, let's go!"

If these people are so intent on the act of collecting experiences, do they find the time to actually accept the experiences themselves? To let impressions unfold and affect them? To savour the moment itself without consideration of its value for their CVs or social media profiles? To ask more rhethorical questions?

These doubts are the reason I keep my own travel plans light on the details and as flexible as possible. They are also the reason I have become fairly selective with the sightseeing I do: Sometimes it's more informative to sit in a cafe and look around, than visit yet another ancient site or museum. I'll be traveling for around a year, so I'm not too concerned about a lack of impressions. There is no rush, which is exactly the point.

I would love to say that this aloof attitude is also the reason why my articles tend to lag 2 weeks behind my actual experiences. Being honest though, that's just because I'm lazy and undisciplined. The way I see it, I'm not actively traveling: I'm just being lazy in different places!
