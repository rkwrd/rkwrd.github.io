            Manali II - No, tell me more about this weed!
          </h1>
          <p>So, Manali. I’ll remember Manali as one of the many places I would have liked to explore further. Since my silly eTourist visa only let me stay in India for 30 days, I only spent a total of 1.5 days in Manali…about as much time as I spent on the bus there and back.</p>

<p>The landscapes around Manali are strikingly beautiful, with forrest-covered mountains, roaring waterfalls and staggering views just begging to be explored in extended hikes. Due to the time constraint (and lack of equipment) I decided to limit my excursions to Manali town. Manali itself is distinctly tourist-y, with that in-your-face mixture of western-style cafes and restaurants, clothes that go well with dreadlocks and a hundred travel agencies.</p>

<p>Four things I recall most keenly:</p>

<p><strong>Weather</strong></p>

<p>The first thing I noticed up there: I did not feel like I was being roasted alive on a pyre of burning stars! Due to the altitude the state of Himachal Pradesh enjoys a temperate climate (and snow in winter!) which felt incredibly refreshing as I had been sweat-soaked ever since I left the Georgian mountains two months earlier. When I reached Manali it was a rainy, foggy, somewhat windy 13°C and loved every second of it.</p>

        <p class="image-caption"></p>

<p>The climate also means that the countryside looks a lot more like the Northern Europe I’m used to. Walking around town in the shade of the tall conifers made me feel oddly…home.</p>

<p>Historical sidenote: The British Raj had its summer residence in the town of Shimla, some hundred kilometers south of Manali for this very reason: British people are as ill-suited for the Indian summer as I am.</p>

<p><strong>Plant life</strong></p>

<p>Given the sheer abundance of natural beauty there is a ton of things you can do. You can buy weed, sell weed, cook with weed, eat weed, drink weed, buy weed paraphernalia, and some people apparently even smoke weed.</p>

<p>And more importantly, you can talk about weed. Since weed is clearly the most interesting topic in the world, there are so many facets to be discussed, weed-smoking-anecdotes to be recounted and hopes of future weed-related adventures to be shared.</p>

<p>This is a view widely shared amongst the crowds of Israeli and Russian backpackers that tend to prowl that whole triangle between Dharamsala, Rishikesh and Manali. Talking to them I found out that some of them had ended up staying in Manali for months when they had planned on staying a few days. Almost as if something made them a bit lazy and passive…</p>

<p>Since I’m not that interested in this side of botany (or other chemical experiments conducted there), I was glad to find two people who were also more interested in the town and we had a look around the town and its surroundings despite the unpredicatable weather and frequent rain.</p>

<p><strong>Mud. Mud everywhere</strong></p>

<p>Oh yes, rain. In a town that doesn’t really do paved roads and is blessed with livestock aplenty. Basically most of Manali is mud of various origins and when I was there I stood in it up to my ankles.</p>

<p>Who said boots weren’t any good for travel in India? For the record: They are. They are absolutely perfect for that.</p>

<p><strong>Impossible interwebs</strong></p>

<p>I had one last educational moment when I logged onto the homestay wifi to send a few emails. Nothing much seemed to happen connection-wise and I tried a ping-command, just to see how bad things were. Oh boy…</p>

<p>The ping tool sends a stream of data packets to a specified destination and measures how long it takes to return. When I ping google.com from home, I get times of 20-50ms. In Manali I did not see any replies coming back at all. Yet the packets did not time out either. Frustrated, I headed out for dinner and when I got back I saw that my loyal packets had indeed returned.</p>

<p>/Users/arne/Google Drive/Google Fotos/IMG_manaliping.jpg</p>

<p>Yes, measured times of 1.6 million ms. That’s 27 minutes.  I didn’t even know that was technically possible and I still suspect that it really shouldn’t be. Either way, I had a good laugh and went to bed.</p>


          <br />
<p>
  Until next time,<br/>
