To World's End


"Great, so you can join us then."

"But...I just got here!"

"Yeah, but there's nothing to do here."

"Man, I haven't slept in two days!"

"Hey, you get one full night and we head out tomorrow morning."

The four of us sit on the balcony and drink beer. Two stories below us the garden is sinking into evening gloom while rain drops keep rolling off the tree tops around us. In the distance the regular racket picks up again: A swelling and ebbing sound somewhere between a flock of hyperactive ducks and a badly maintained machine gun. Horny frogs, apparently, flirting loudly. Every now and then a swooping shadow in the sky catches my eye as one of the huge fruit bats takes flight.

"Did you guys buy tickets yet?"

"We were thinking we'd just go down to the station and ask them for the easiest way to get to Nuraw-...Nawuru-"

"Nuwara Eliya."

"That. So basically it would be a a few people from this hostel and us four."


Us, that's Hayden, Sam, Krzysztof and myself. While Sam has just arrived, the rest of us have already spent a day or two in Kandy, Sri Lanka. All of us arrived a week too late for the big Perahera festival and have already seen the things we wanted to see in town. In my case this list comprised the Temple of the Tooth (built around Gautama Buddha's tooth - swanky temples are exactly what that man was all about), the botanical garden and the Commonwealth War Cemetery. Other than that I felt that Kandy was just a tad too noisy, crowded and busy for my taste. When somebody suggested to go south towards the big national parks I eagerly jumped on that plan. In the course of this evening a combination of bizarre and hilarious conversation (and more than a few beers) also convinces Sam to join us. 

The next morning we eat an early breakfast, pack up our belongings and head out to rustle up a few tuktuks to take us down to the station. Since the other three are also travelling for longer periods they carry as little luggage as I do. A few others from the hostel, on the other hand, are there on vacation and have about two bags per person. Tuktuks don't have a whole lot of stowage so the short ride to the station ends up a being a rather cramped experience.

"So there is a train at 1pm."

"Hm, our accommodation is only reserved until 2pm or so, so we'd miss that..."

"What, we have accommodation planned?"

"Well, the lady from the hostel sorted out something..."

"What's the place called?"

"No clue, she gave the info to this one girl..."

"The blond one?"

"I don't know...is the blond girl also the tall girl?"

"..."


Based on such definitive schedules we decided to take a small but air-conditioned shuttle bus instead, which would get us there on time for that dubious reservation.
