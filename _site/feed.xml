        <title>Another travel blog?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as I had settled in on Thessaloniki&amp;rsquo;s lustrous promenade, my peace was disturbed by a scary thought. Staring into the sunset over the bay and puffing on my lone celebratory cigar I was startled by the question &amp;ldquo;What if my friends forget about me?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before my departure some of my friends had indeed asked for regular status updates on my trip and/or whether my head was still attached to my shoulders (Day 1: yes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cleary keeping my friends informed individually seems like a lot of repetition, which makes it very likely that I would eventually start neglecting that part, possibly losing touch. However, this could easily be solved by putting some regular updates online at a central location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I don&amp;rsquo;t really like or trust Facebook anymore, so putting all my stuff on there didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly appeal to me either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious consequence then is a blog, something I had discussed with some of my friends as well.
Here is the problem though: Since I am now traveling, my blog would be a travel blog. I don&amp;rsquo;t like travel blogs.
Whilst preparing for my trip I had skimmed through many travel blogs and quite simply I thought too many of them were shit. 
Most of them seem to consist of listicles (a topic worthy of a rant of its own. Spoiler: I don&amp;rsquo;t like them.), &amp;ldquo;me at the beach&amp;rdquo; type pictures and rather heavy-handed prose.
Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that&amp;rsquo;s not the kind of blog I would want to spend time on. Partially because of my drastic aversion to listicles, partially since I&amp;rsquo;m way too pale to be photographed at the beach. Lastly, I&amp;rsquo;m not under the delusion that I&amp;rsquo;m any kind of Hemingway.
So what is this blog going to be then? 
Hopefully not a travel blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as I enjoy traveling, this undertaking was never meant to be about the travel itself. Instead, I wanted to have the freedom and energy to immerse myself in topics I find interesting. Instead of going the formal-education route and earning another degree, I decided to pursue those interests on my own but at locations which are all a) sunnier, b) cheaper and c) friendlier than my birthplace. And if that&amp;rsquo;s the idea, why limit myself to one location? There, that&amp;rsquo;s how it accidentally turned into a trip.
So ideally, this blog will be mainly be growing on articles on the topics I&amp;rsquo;m researching (and of course various vitriolic rants).
I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see if I can put together content at a respectable frequency. in that regard this blog also serves as an experiment on my (lack of) self discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despair not, ye of little faith, I will surely write the occasional bit on my whereabouts (and yes, the status of my neck) and post pictures of beaches, wine-glasses and my horribly sun-burned mug. Hell, I might even take a shot at some destination-related articles with a bit of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see if I can put together content at a respectable frequency. in that regard this blog also serves as an experiment on my (lack of) self discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the technically inclined amongst my esteemed readers: This blog is static html rendered using Jekyll. It&amp;rsquo;s currently hosted on github pages, though I might move it to my own server at some point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pleasantly simple theme I&amp;rsquo;m using is called &amp;ldquo;scribble&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
