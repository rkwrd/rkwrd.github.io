            Yerevan II - The city
          </h1>
          <p>So here’s the deal: I’m in Sri Lanka. My last article was in Armenia. That’s way behind, and I find it harder and harder to pretend I’m bothered by my own tardiness. Yes, I’m very forgiving that way. I’ve also gotten a bit tired of the overall style of this site: Went here, went there, did this, did that. Since I’m largely writing this for my own benefit (sorry) and to aid my memory, this doesn’t really do much for me: I already have that sort of information in my pictures (and Google’s GPS data…). At the same time I actually do enjoy writing about this journey in general. So maybe it’s time to try out a different writing style, a different method? Move away from itineraries to moments and impressions? From here on it’s going to be heavy-handed prose and pretty pictures all the way…maybe!</p>

<h3 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h3>

<p>I’m bad with first impressions. By that I mean: I tend to get a bad first impression places and people. One of the main reasons is that I’m a certifiable retard in terms of scheduling my travels. As a result, I often arrive in new places at night, which I deal with badly. There is something about setting foot into a new city after dark that feels like stepping out into the dark jungle. By that point I’m usually tired (and grumpy), which isn’t really the mindset for exploration or adventure.</p>

<p>By some one-in-a-million stroke of luck, my arrival in Yerevan happened in the early morning hours. On a sunny day, no less! Somehow, that made all the difference and I was quite excited to have a look at the city. So was my companion:</p>

    </a>
    
    
        <p class="image-caption"></p>
    
</div>

<p>After disembarking at Yerevan central, we stepped out into the sun and grabbed a taxi to my hostel. The driver took us through the city centre, which was entirely quiet due to the early morning hours. Quiet, and totally not what I had expected Yerevan to be like. Somehow, my image of Armenia had been that of an impoverished, agrarian nation. To put it bluntly, I had expected Yerevan to be a poorer, downtrodden version of Tbilisi. I was wrong. The city we saw was grand.</p>

<p>One reason for the elegant cityscape we found ourselves in was that the Soviets “re-designed” the city in the 1960s. The result was a modern, open and airy plan for the city. On top of that, everywhere we looked, the city was well-cared for: No trash, no litter, no graffiti. The city gave of a surprisingly westernized vibe: Even off the main drag we saw various boutique stores, nice coffee shops and restaurants.</p>

        <p class="image-caption"></p>
    
</div>

<p>Later that day I found myself exploring the Cascades, a huge complex of art installations in the north of the city centre.</p>

    </a>
    
    
        <p class="image-caption"></p>
    
</div>

<p>Amongst other statues, the Cascades are also home to one of my favorite sculptures, a huge black lion fashioned from tire parts:</p>

    </a>
    
    
        <p class="image-caption">The way the sculpture captures all the traits of a predator gives you an almost physical sensation of menace</p>
    
</div>

<p>Having climbed all the stairs to the top of the Cascades, I was rewarded by this fantastic view of the city</p>

    </a>
    
    
        <p class="image-caption">Barely visible through the haze you can see Mt. Arahat</p>
    
</div>

        <img src="http://localhost:4000/pics/IMG_20150608_100944_scaled.jpg" alt="Image" />
    
    </a>
    
    
        <p class="image-caption"></p>
    
</div>

<p>In the end I probably sat up top for almost an hour, slowly roasting away in the hot afternoon sun. Whenever I thought I was done, I noticed something new in the panorama before me. I couldn’t help but notice how beautiful a city Yerevan really is. It’s almost ridiculous how surprised I was by that.</p>

          <br />

  Until next time,<br/>
